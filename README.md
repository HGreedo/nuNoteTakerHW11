# nuNoteTakerHW11
https://hgreedo.github.io/nuNoteTakerHW11/ - for whatever reason this link is not functional. However, from my localhost I am able to create and display a working note taker. GitHub is saying that it's an issue with one of the ReadMe.md files withing Node Modules and a bracket not having a closing tag. Weird. - will include video down below to show functionality. - Harry
